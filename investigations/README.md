1. find high-quality care hospital: evaluate average score (group by hospital) on effective care, readmission, and the combination of the two. 
2. find high-quality care model state: evaluate average score (group by state) on effective care, readmission, and the combination of the two. 
3. find procedure variability: evaluate variance (group by measure name) on effective care.
4. find correlation between survey and hospital quality: evaluate correlations between effective care score and 26 survey questions.
